# httpy: Modern, user-friendly, programmable command-line HTTP client for the API

httpy is a command line HTTP client.
Its purpose is to make duplicate web requests on a single line.
httpy is designed for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with APIs and HTTP servers.
The `httpy` command allows creating and sending arbitrary HTTP requests.
They use simple and natural syntax and provide formatted and colored output.
Thanks to its programmable structure, it can perform many tasks at the same time.
For example, you can extract data for user IDs 0, 1, and 2 at the same time
